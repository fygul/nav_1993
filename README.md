# Introduction
This archival repository contains some legacy BASIC programs for ship sailing and operation. I used them on a **[CASIO FX-870P](http://pocket.free.fr/html/casio/fx-870p_e.html)** packet computer during 1992-1993. After I left my deck officer career, I no longer maintained them.

If you're interesting in using CASIO FX-870P and BASIC,
you may find the links of unofficial on-line FX-870P manual and BASIC reference at '*[Listado de Calculadoras Casio programables en BASIC](http://basic.hopto.org/basic/casio.php)*'.

# Program list
The original programs were typed and stored in RAM. I didn't buy any accessory to export source code, so I re-typed and restored them to three files on a desktop computer.

## P1.bas
MARITIME PROGRAMS

1. MERCATOR SAILING
2. DEAD RECKONING
3. GREAT CIRCLE SAILING
4. DEC/GHA OF SUN
5. MERIDIAN PASS
6. SUNRISE/SUNSET & TWILIGHT
7. ALTITUDE CALCULATION
8. STAR FINDING
9. SIGHT REDUCTION
10. RELATIVE MOTION

## P2.bas
MARITIME PROGRAMS PART II

1. NP159*TIDAL PREDICTION/HARMONIC
2. TIDE CALCULATION
3. ETA CALCULATION
4. WIND DIRECTION/FORCE
5. AMPLITUDE

## P3.bas
CARGO LOADING/DISCHARGING

1. DISPLACEMENT CALCULATION
2. TRIMMING
3. LOADING & STRESS CALCULATION
4. STRESS CALCULATION
5. FINAL TRIMMING WITH TWO HOLDS
6. AIR DRAFT CALCULATION

The data in P3.bas is only for M.V. CEMTEX ORIENT built in 1990.

# Origin and evolution
I received original source code of these programs from Captain Wang, the then Master of M.V. CEMTEX ORIENT. Later, I rewrote a large portion of them, except for P3.bas which was nearly untouched. I also wrote several new programs to support my daily tasks, and eventually expanded to status quo.

Although it's not a good practice, I sometimes concatenated several statements in one line to save storage due to constraint, limitation of such small storage capacity of RAM.
